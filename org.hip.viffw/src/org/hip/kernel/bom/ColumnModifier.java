 * This interface defines the behaviour of classes which modify the
 * WHERE clause of SQL statements, i.g. it offers the possibility to
 * create statements like UCASE(columnName).
 * Because the concrete modification (i.e. the field function) depends
 * on the chosen database, each modifier/function has to be implemented for each
 * database adapter.
