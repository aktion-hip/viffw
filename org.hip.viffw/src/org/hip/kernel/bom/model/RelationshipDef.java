/** Defines keys for objects. A key identifies an object. We can distinguish between a primaryKey and a secondaryPrimary
 * Key. A primary key is used to establish assosiations between objects. Today, primary keys are surrogates such as the
 * DCE UUId, the CORBA IOR etc. If good designed, they are universelly unique. Secondary primary keys are unique only
 * within a given context. Examples of secondary primary keys are: ISBN for books, EAN for partners. The actual version
 * of this framework does NOT support secondary primary keys. (Even if this support is prepared.)
