/** This interface has to be implemented by workflow aware objects.<br/>
 * Specific application semantics for states and transitions can be implemented as methods of the class implementing
 * this interface.<br/>
 * These methods get associated with the individual states and transitions by a simple naming scheme. For example, if a
 * Workflow has two states 'Private' and 'Public', and a transition 'Publish' that goes from 'Private' to 'Public', the
 * following happens when the transition is executed:
 *
 * 1. if implemented, the method <code>onLeave_Private</code> is called (it is called each time the object leaves the
 * 'Private' state)
 *
 * 2. if implemented, the method <code>onTransition_Publish</code> is called (it is called whenever this transition is
 * executed)
 *
 * 3. if implemented, the method <code>onEnter_Public</code> is called (it is called each time the object enters the
 * 'Public' state)
